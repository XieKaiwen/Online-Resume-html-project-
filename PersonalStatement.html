    <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
    <h2>Written by Kaiwen</h2>

    <p>
      The reason why I chose to pursue computer science (CS) as a degree started
      with my interest in this CS being piqued after I watched the movie
      "imitation game" back in JC. I was intrigued by the character Alan Turing,
      the father of modern computer science. While researching about him, I
      learnt about his ideas such as the Turing machine and Turing test.
      Curiosity led me to probe further, and I inevitably plunged into the CS
      rabbithole. <br /><br />
      In JC, I have participated in Singapore Physics League, Singapore
      Chemistry Olympiad, obtaining bronze in both. I also took up H3 Chemistry,
      which I achieved distinction in, and was working on a 4-year long
      chemistry research project in the School Scientist Programme. All these
      activities required me to learn far beyond the syllabus. Not only did I
      have to learn the advanced concepts, but I had to <b>understand how to
      flexibly apply the concepts to perform well</b>. For instance, I had to
      thoroughly understand the theory behind my research to defend our research
      paper during evaluation. I am <b>extremely capable in terms of learning
      something in-depth</b>. Hence, despite CS becoming rather technical as we dive
      deeper into it, I can excel in it. <br /><br />
      Through my research, I <b>refined many soft skills</b>. For 4 years, I had to
      devote most of my time after school and a huge portion of our holidays to
      the lab, performing experiments and analysing data. It trained my <u>time
      management</u>, since I had to juggle this project, my curriculum and my
      co-curricular activities. The programme initially had 11 students but only
      6 of them (including me) graduated, it was a huge commitment that many
      could not handle. Throughout the project, to solve the many problems I
      faced optimally with limited resources, I had to accurately deduce the
      root of the problems, hence <u>training my critical thinking</u>. I did not
      always have the best options and had to make do with the resources
      available to me, <u>training my resourcefulness</u>. My dedication to the project
      shows <b>I can commit strongly</b> to whatever I decide to pursue. I took
      computing as an additional subject back in high school. I learnt basic
      concepts, such as data structures and object-oriented programming, and
      languages like Python and JavaScript. I took a Udemy course called
      "Beginning C++ Programming-From Beginner to Beyond" to challenge myself,
      since C++ is designed to give the user greater control over the computer's
      memory which makes it harder to learn and use. I have also used online
      resources like Kaggle to <u>learn basic data engineering</u>. In fact, I have
      taken "Machine Learning Specialisation" on Coursera to learn about the
      different types of learning, learning algorithms and implementation of
      open-source libraries like TensorFlow. I also participated in the Uber
      Global Hackathon 2023 in the data analytics category to get some <u>practical
      experience in handling data with Python</u>.<br /><br />
      I will enjoy studying the field of CS, especially since it is extensively
      linked with the mathematics field. I have been reading "Introduction to
      Algorithms" by MIT and the experience is thoroughly enjoyable. The
      Strassen algorithm discussed in the book impressed me, I was surprised by
      its ingenious use of matrix addition, which led to the breakthrough in
      reducing time complexity for matrix multiplication. I was also impressed
      with the usage of recurrence trees in solving recurrence time complexity,
      an simple but very effective method. Moreover, field of deep learning
      fascinating to me. A study done by Gašper Beguš compared the brain waves
      of a human to the signal produced by discriminator in a GAN model when
      "listening" to the same sound. The experiment showed how shockingly
      similar the inner workings of these systems are, through the extremely
      identical response. This study aims to develop a way to describe how the
      brain processes and learns languages. I am amazed by how useful deep
      learning has been used to study tricky concepts, contributing
      significantly to various disciplinaries and its wide range of uses.
