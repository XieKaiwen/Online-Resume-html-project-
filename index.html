    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I am a student from Hwa Chong Institution and a prospective NUS CS
      student. <br />
      I am interested in 3 particular areas in CS, software engineering, game
      development and machine learning.<br />
      I am capable, efficient, dedicated and a fast learner, which enables me to
      be good at picking up skills and also learning with depth. <br />
      I have challenged myself in the past and I believe I have tackled these
      challenges rather successfully.<br /><br />
      I have experiences in problem solving, project management and good at time
      management. <br />

      For more information, you can refer to my personal statement I have
      written for my college applications.

    <ul>
      <li><h3>Graduating School Scientist Programme in HCI</h3></li>
      <p>
        <b>Description</b>: Participated in a Chemistry research project from
        2019 to 2022, under the School Scientist programme. Initial intake for
        this programme was 11 students but only 6 students, including me,
        graduated. Required substantial amounts of commitment.
      </p>
      <li><h3>Bronze Medal in Singapore Chemistry Olympiad</h3></li>
      <p>
        <b>Description</b>: Pariticpated in the SCHO in 2021 and obtained bronze
        medal while competing with other JC students
      </p>
      <li><h3>Bronze Medal in Singapore Physics League</h3></li>
      <p>
        <b>Description</b>: Participated in the 1st Singapore Physics League
        senior category, a 4 hour competition where students race to solve
        physics problems. Competing against 300 teams of JC students in
        Singapore, my group won the Bronze Awards and achieved 27th place
        overall.

      <li>
        <h3>
          Regional Finalists for Virtual Global Hackathon - Data analysis
          Category
        </h3>
      </li>
      <p>
        <b>Description</b>: Competed through two rounds, we were required to
        identify a problem and use the data we extracted from massive datasets
        to justify it, then come up with feasible solutions. Second round
        required a presentation of our report. We obtained regional finalists.
        It was a good practice for handling data using python libraries such as
        MatPlotlib
